Ebee aims to be a modern, feature-rich alternative for communities that value privacy and control. The project is currently in the early stages of development.

## 🗺️ Project Roadmap

Here are some of the core features planned for the initial versions of Ebee:

*   **🔐 User Authentication:** Secure user registration and login system.
*   **💬 Real-time Messaging:** Live text-based communication within channels.
*   **🏢 Server & Channel Structure:** Organize conversations into separate servers and channels.
*   **👥 User Profiles & Roles:** Basic user profiles and a simple permission system.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

The planned technology stack for Ebee is:

*   **Frontend:** [e.g., React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS]
*   **Backend:** PHP
*   **Database:** A relational database (e.g., MySQL, MariaDB)
*   **Real-time Communication:** To be determined (exploring WebSockets or Long-Polling)

## 🚀 Getting Started

Ebee is in the very early stages of development, and a stable version is not yet available for deployment. Setup instructions for developers will be added here as the project matures.

### Prerequisites

A typical local development environment will require:

*   A web server with PHP (e.g., Apache, Nginx)
*   A MySQL/MariaDB database
*   Composer for managing PHP dependencies.
